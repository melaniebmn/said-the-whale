## ORCA WHALES
<p>An orca is a marine mammal, they are actually dolphins. In fact, they are the largest member of the dolphin family! Dolphins and whales are closely related – both are in the order Cetacea, which includes whales, dolphins, and porpoises.</p>
<br/>
<p>Orcas were given the name "killer whale" by ancient sailors' observations of groups of orcas hunting and preying on larger whale species.</p>
<br/>
<p>They called orcasasesina ballenas, or "whale killer" – a term that was eventually flipped around to the easier "killer whale".</p>

## BELUGA WHALES
<p>From one point of view, we can never know if beluga whales really love music. However, they do respond and express great curiosity and even sometimes join in synchronized dance.</p>
<br/>
<p>In 2013, a pair of artists rigged a boat with an underwater sound system and sailed out to sea in order to play the belugas an underwater symphony.</p>
<br/>
<p>The whales were extremely interested and even joined in, showing an appreciation for music and art above and beyond most known creatures on Earth.</p>

## HUMPBACK WHALES
<p>Whales can make a variety of sounds. One whale in captivity, a whale called NOC, became so good at mimicking human voices that researches thought they were overhearing two people conversing in the distance.</p>
<br/>
<p>This went on for a while until the whale convinced a diver in his tank that someone was shouting at him to surface.</p>
<br/>
<p>NOC produced these sounds by unnaturally varying the pressure in his nasal tract and inflating a sac in his blowhole.</p>
